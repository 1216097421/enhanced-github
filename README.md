## Github API Rate Limiting

Since this extension fetches data using Github public v3 API for showing file *size* and *download_url*, it consumes free quota which is very less [Github API Rate Limiting](https://developer.github.com/v3/rate_limit/).

To tackle this, create a new Github Access Token.

1. If logged-in, visit [https://github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Generate a new token, select `repo` scope and create a one.
3. Copy and store the generated token which looks something like: `17c1a8d5b399d66b6212382d98d4c67a94d58955` (a fake one :P).
4. Click on extension icon and then on `Settings-Options` on top right.

	OR

	Go to [chrome://extensions](http://chrome://extensions), find github-plus and click on `Options`.

5. Enter the valid Github Access Token
6. Click on `SAVE` and Enjoy the benefits.

This Chrome extension will automatically pick this valid access token and Bingo!
